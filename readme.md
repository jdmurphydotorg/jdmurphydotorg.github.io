&nbsp; This is my personal website. It's a 'digital garden' I am building using Foam and VSCode. It will always be a work in progress. 

&nbsp; I work for International Leadership of Texas as a Videographer. I studied Computer Science with minors in English and Studio Art at Dallas Baptist University. I am interested in filmmaking, game development, and architecture. My main goal is to become a licensed architect, and soon I will link here the outline of my plan to get there.
