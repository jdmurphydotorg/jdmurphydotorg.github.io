&nbsp; This is my personal website. It's a 'digital garden' I am building using Foam and VSCode.

&nbsp; I am twenty-two years old and work for International Leadership of Texas as a Videographer. I studied Computer Science with minors in English and Studio Art at Dallas Baptist University, and started working as an audio engineer my sophomore year, leading to my career in audio for motion picture. I am interested in filmmaking, game development, and architecture. My goal is to become a licensed architect.
